# AirBnB Clone – Full-Stack Web Application

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform **Airbnb**. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to **browse property listings**, **view detailed information**, and **complete bookings**. It covers **frontend development**, **backend APIs**, **database design**, and **deployment**.  
**Tech stack** includes **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** (with React or similar), **Git & GitHub** for version control, and **Figma** for UI/UX design.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

### 🎯 Design Goals

Our goal is to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience that ensures smooth navigation and functionality across all devices. Key design objectives include:

- Prioritizing mobile responsiveness for all user interfaces
- Ensuring fast loading times
- Creating an intuitive booking flow

### ⭐ Key Features

To achieve a user-centric experience, the following features will be implemented:

- 🔍 Property Search and Filtering – Users can search listings using location, date, and property filters
- 👤 User Authentication – Account creation, login/logout, and session handling
- 🔐 Secure Checkout Process – Streamlined and secure booking flow
- 🏠 Detailed Property Viewing – Includes images, amenities, host info, and availability

### 🧾 Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name             | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Listing Detailed View | Full property details, image gallery, description, and booking form       |

A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system to ensure a smooth and frictionless user journey. It:

- Improves **accessibility** and **retention** across various devices and screen sizes
- Enhances **user satisfaction** through clear and predictable navigation

Effective UI/UX fosters trust, especially in transactional systems like accommodation bookings, where users must feel confident sharing personal and payment information.
